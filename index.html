            <h2>Early life</h2>
            <p>
                Swift had a passion for music at a young age, and she moved fast from playing parts in children's
                theater to making her stage debut in front of thousands of people. Before a Philadelphia 76ers
                basketball game, at the age of 11, she sung "The Star-Spangled Banner." The following year, she
                picked up the guitar and started writing songs. Swift created original music that represented her
                experiences with tween isolation, drawing influence from country music performers like Shania Twain
                and the Dixie Chicks (now the Chicks). Swift's parents moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee, when she
                was 13 years old, giving her more time to pursue country labels in Nashville, which is nearby.
